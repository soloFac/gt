            Since 1972 GT Bicycles has proudly been developing bikes, for every type of rider, 
            with a consistent mission. That mission is the same reason everybody throws a leg over their 
            very first bike – pure fun, plain and simple. GTBicycles remains true to sharing the stoke on two
            wheels which the brand was founded on because, after all, you can’t have Good Times without ‘GT’!
